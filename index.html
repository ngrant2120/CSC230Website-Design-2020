            <strong>Hello, my name is Nick Grant</strong>, and it is my goal to create a professional facing website 
                that can serve to represent the best of that which I have to offer.</p>
      
            <p>I have been exposed to Information Technology elements for as long as I can remember. It wasn't until 2012 however that I made the decision to
                pursue a devoted career path within the world of IT.</p>
      
            <p>I graduated from <em>ITT Tech</em> in 2014 with an Associates of Science in Network Engineering. Acquiring that degree served as a major stepping stone
                to getting my foot in the door. After gaining five years of real world technical experience, I decided to re-enroll in school at <em>Sullivan University</em>
                to acquire a Bachelore's of Science in Information Technology. Currently, I am set to graduate with my <strong>BSIT Degree</strong>
                in June of 2012.</p>
